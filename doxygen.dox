 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * This library provides two modes of operation for up to four USART's:
 * \li Normal mode without additional buffers.
 * \li Interrupt based mode with separate circular transmitting and receiving buffers for each enabled USART
 *
 * Mixing modes of operation is supported, e.g. USART0 in interrupt based mode, and USART1 in normal mode.
 * For now only supported data format is 8N1.
 *
 * \subsection changelog_sec Changelog
 * \version 2.0 - 11.03.2016
 * - removed bug in ATmega161
 * - small changes in hardware definitions
 * \version 2.0 - 10.03.2016
 * \li removed bug in usart_lib.c - wrong conditional compilation
 * \version 2.0 - 08.03.2016
 * \li full library rewrite, whole usage change
 * \li added doxygen generated documentation
 * \li supported: ATmega162, ATmega48, ATmega88, ATmega168, ATmega328, ATmega640, ATmega1280, ATmega1281, ATmega2560, ATmega2561, Atmega16, ATmega32, ATmega323, ATmega8
 * 
 * \todo
 * \li add support for more AVR MCU's
 * \li add support for more frame formats
 * \li add support for MPCM
 *
 * \section usage_sec Usage
 *
 * \li Include usart_lib.h in your sources.
 * \li Define proper macros, below details.
 * \note All definitions  should be passed in CFLAGS to AVR-GCC. Editing usart_lib.h isn't preferred.
 * \li Desired USART must be initialized before use. In both modes procedure looks identical. Simply call usartInit(usartNumber_T, uint16_t) function.
 *
 * \subsection normal_sec Normal usage
 *
 * \li Define minimum one USART to use: USE_USART0, USE_USART1, USE_USART2, USE_USART3.
 * \li Use functions provided for this purpose.
 *
 * \sa normal_grp
 *
 * \subsection interrupt_sec Interrupt based usage
 *
 * \li Define minimum one USART to use. e.g. USE_USART0_INTERRUPT, USE_USART1_INTERRUPT, USE_USART1_INTERRUPT, USE_USART1_INTERRUPT. 
 * \li Additional define buffers length separate for every USART transmitter and receiver. e.g. USART0_RX_BUFFER_LENGTH=32, USART0_TX_BUFFER_LENGTH=64.
 * \note Buffer length must be power of 2 and not exceed 256. If you not define buffers for used USART both buffers will be 16 bytes length.
 * \li Use functions provided for this purpose.
 *
 * \warning If interrupt mode isn't used for given USART it should not be enabled by macro USE_USARTx_INTERRUPT.
 * It'll use some flash for two ISR (for receiver and transmitter) and some RAM for buffers!
 * \sa interrupt_grp
 *
 * Always newest version here: https://github.com/ryba84/usart_lib
 * \example interrupt_mode.c
